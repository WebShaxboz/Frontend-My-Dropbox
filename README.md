### Introduction

    First, what is dropbox? :)
Amazon has a free tier. You should be able to host it for 0$. :)

Dropbox is a file hosting service operated by the American company Dropbox, Inc., headquartered in San Francisco, California, that offers cloud storage, file synchronization, personal cloud, and client software.

=> File synchronization, that sounds cool!

    Secondly, what is serverless?
Serverless computing is a method of providing backend services on an as-used basis. Servers are still used, but a company that gets backend services from a serverless vendor is charged based on usage, not a fixed amount of bandwidth or number of servers.

=> We configure a backend at from a provider and it will handle the load/scaling for us.

Let's implement a file synchronization using Amplify & Lambda & S3
